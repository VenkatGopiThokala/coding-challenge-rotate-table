# coding-challenge-rotate-table

This was done using Javascript.

cli.js -> contains the logic of the challange

input.csv -> is the input file for the program.

output.csv -> program writes the output to this.


I have used multiple scenarios for testing, all are mentioned in input.csv file.

You can execute the program with the following command:

`node cli.js input.js`
