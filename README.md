# coding-challenge-rotate-table

This was done using Javascript.

cli.js -> contains the logic of the challange

input.csv -> is the input file for the program.

output.csv -> program writes the output to this.


I have used multiple scenarios for testing, all are mentioned in input.csv file.

You can execute the program with the following command:

`node cli.js input.js`

# Error Handling
Error handling was done inside the computation itself. if any input throws an error, the system will throw the error for that certain entry and continue working on the other entries.

Corresponding errors can be found in the output file.

For the same, one can run input.csv to check the errors.
